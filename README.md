# Image-Labeling-Helper
Makes image or CAPTCHA labeling work faster.

Requirements:
- Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- PySimpleGUI (After installing Python, open "Command Prompt", type "pip install PySimpleGUI")

How to run:
Execute the Python script.

Demo:
1. Select Files
Click "Browse" to select one / more files from your computer to label (only support ".png" only).
Then click "Next" to continue.

It may take some time if you select hundreds or thousands of file. (1k file around 1 minute to wait if your computer is slow.)

2. Label images.
Start labeling your images.

Several things are shown in the window:
- The title [1/8] indicates your progress, you are labeling the first image out of eight images.
- Current file name is shown at the title too.
- An image.
- An input box for labeling data.

Things you could do:
- Input anything in input box, then click "Previous" or "Next" will immediately update your image's file name.
- Inputing nothing will not rename images. The program will just go to previous / next image.
